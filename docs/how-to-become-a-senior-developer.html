<p>The full name of this post should really be: "How to become a senior developer, by somebody who is one, relayed to you by somebody who isn't one".</p>
<p>I recently sat down with my employer Circular Wave's co-founder and CTO Ashley Rudland, for my end-of -first-year-as-a-developer catch up. Amongst a whole ton of stuff one of the primary topics we discussed was the notion of what it would take for me to get from where I currently am, a junior developer with one year's professional experience, all the way to to being a senior developer. Ash is well suited to address this topic, having something like sixteen years of professional development experience under his belt.</p>
<p>After a discussion around what I personally thought would be the most imporant skills for a senior developer to posses, Ash wrote down his own well considered thoughts around this, neatly split into 5 separate bullet points, and crucially in order of importance. Seeing Ash' list was eye-opening for me, specifically because I was surprised at how he'd prioritised the skills.</p>
<p>With Ash' permission I've gone into detail below on his list of the five most important skills required of a senior developer, in order (from most important to least).</p>
