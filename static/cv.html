                    <p>As the company continued to hire more senior developers, the necessity for me to work in a technical capacity lessened, and my role instead became focused on Scrum Master and Agile Project Management duties.</p>

                    <p>As the company‚Äôs CTO made the decision to step away from working on the tech side of the business, I was invited to step up into the development team lead role, initially on a trial basis, and later in a more official capacity. This was partly an admin/management role, and partly a role in which I would provide technical assistance to the more junior members of the development team.</p>

                    <p class="cv-page-date">JULY 2016 - JANUARY 2018</p>
                    <p>After graduating from Makers Academy I got my first development job with this small healthcare tech startup (so small in fact that I was one of their first two hires). I initially worked on updating and maintaining a pre-existing MVP app built with Ionic/Angular JS, with a Node.js monolith back end. I was later tasked with being part of a very small team which rebuilt that product using React and React Native, with a Node.js microservice architecture on the back end.</p>

                    <p>Due to a background in art, web design and visual effects I was contracted to work for a short while at this mechanical engineering company as an interface designer, producing design layouts and graphical assets for a range of human machine interfaces. This soon led to full-time employment at the same company, and an eventual expansion of my role to also include technical authoring and technical illustration. After working at this company for several years I eventually decided it was time for a career change, and left to attend the Makers Academy web development bootcamp.</p>

                    <p>I moved from Ascent Media to a similar role at this large visual effects company, which offered better prospects for training and career progression. Here I continued to carry out logistical duties whilst training to become a visual effects compositor. Unfortunately though my career in visual effects came to an abrupt end when the global recession of 2008/9 hit, quickly leading to the redundancies of myself and many of my colleagues.</p>
