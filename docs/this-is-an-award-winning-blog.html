<p>Very soon after receiving a rejection from <a href="my-first-developer-job-application.html" class="link">my first developer job application</a> my mood was lifted significantly, when I was informed that this little blog of mine had been selected by Makers Academy as the winner of their best blog competition!</p>
<p>Of course the kudos of being selected out of everybody in my cohort for the best blog award is a prize in itself, but the ¬£250 cash prize will definitely help to keep the wolves from the doot until I manage to find some gainful employment again.</p>
<p>So there you have it, you're now reading an award winning blog, haha.</p></div>
