      <p>I'm a software developer working at Circular Wave in London, England, where we're striving to make the NHS a nicer place to
        work.</p>
      <p>Outside of software development I've had several year's experience working as a technical author, a technical
        illustrator and an interface designer for the engineering industry. A long time ago I also worked in film and TV post production.</p>
      <p>I'm hungry to learn, and I have a big interest in teaching and sharing what I learn, which is largely the reason for this blog's existence.</p>
        <p>I live in Kent with my wife and two sons.</p>
