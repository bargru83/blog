The full name of this post should really read: "How to become a senior developer, from somebody who is one, relayed to you by somebody who isn't one".

I recently sat down with my employer Circular Wave's co-founder and CTO Ashley Rudland, for my end-of -first-year-as-a-developer catch up meeting. Amongst a whole ton of stuff one of the main topics we discussed was the what it would take for me to get from where I currently am, a junior developer with one year's professional experience, all the way to to being a senior developer. Ash is well suited to address this topic, having something like sixteen years of professional development experience under his belt.

After a discussion around what I personally thought would be the most imporant skills for a senior developer to posses, Ash then wrote down his own well considered thoughts around this, neatly split into 5 separate bullet points, and crucially in order of importance. Seeing Ash' list was eye-opening for me, and I was definitely surprised at how he'd prioritised the skills. Many of these skills come with experience, so naturally aren't posessed by too many junior developers. However by surrounding yourself with more experienced developers these skills can be aquired earlier than experince would usually allow.

With Ash' permission I've gone into detail below on his list of the five most important skills required of a senior developer, in order (from most important to least).

# Persistence, resilience & emotional control

This is the most important skill that a senior developer should posses. A good senior developer shouldn't get flustered by, or frustrated with their work. While a junior developer might reach a point where they give up and ask for help, a senior developer should always have the confidence in their abilities, and the resilient attitude and perserverence to keep chipping away at the problem, until eventually they'll solve it. Even in the face of major adversity, a senior developer will get the job done.

# Semantic tree analysis & problem solving



# Shipping product fast & customer value

I liken this skill to having the ability to remove yourself from the current situation, and view it from 10,000 feet above instead.

There have been times where I've personally been handed a task to complete, and that task has eventually proven much trickier than anybody had accounted for. As a junior developer, my mind naturally moves toward 'how can I get this working as specified?'. I want to complete the task that I've been given, because anything less feels like giving up or asking for help with something that I should be capable of doing alone. Several times Ash has eventually got involded when it's clear that I've been having problems. While I've been deep down in the trenches, surrounded by broken code that I'm trying hard to fix, Ash would say something like: 'Okay that's much more complicated than we thought it would be, why don't we try *this* instead. It's a different solution, but will be just as useful for the customer'. What I'm referring to is the senior developer ability to view things from a higher perspective, and ask what the customer actually wants or needs, and how can we quickly get an approximation of that to them. It's asking the big questions, not just 'how can we build this feature', but 'should we even be building this feature? Is there a simpler way to produce the same result for the end user?'.

# Tech ability

I was very surprised at how low tech ability rates in this list, because I gave it the number 1 spot in my own list.

# Architecture / Foresight for roadmap

A senior developer should always keep an eye on the underlying architecture of their product. There are always ways of speeding up, simplifying or optimising the architecture, and these methods can often provide a far larger benefit than simply trying to optimise code.

A junior developer will try to write code that works. A mid-level developer will try to write code that's well optimised. A senior developer will look at hosting their code in a more optimal environment, and delivering it to the end user is the most optimal way possible. Optimising code can have a big impact, but getting the architecture right can totally change the game.
