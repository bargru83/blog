    <p class="in-post-date">5th April 2018</p>
    <div class="post-content"><p>At this moment in time, we're seeing rapidly increasing adoption of the #deleteFacebook and #deleteGoogle movements. It's not the first time and it won't be the last that privacy issues have caused people to sit up and wonder whether it's really such a great idea to launch a fire hose of our own private data directly toward these huge corporate funnels, who wish only to use that data for their own financial benefit.</p>
<p>At regular intervals, around once every six months, I start to take seriously the notion of leaving these corporations and their shady data-mining practices behind. However after making a list of everything that's required from me to do so, and everything that I'd be leaving behind, the act has always seemed not quite worth the trouble.</p>
<p>Google would be the easier of the two for me to escape. While their online offerings are excellent, alternatives do exist. Facebook, however, has become like an insidious intruder that has slowly made itself almost inescapable. I use it (and it's acquisitions such as Instagram and WhatsApp) as a primary method of communication with friends and family, but also as a kind of online passport. A few years ago before I became wiser to the risks involved I took every opportunity to use Facebook's authentication system to sign up to any other online services that I wanted to join that offered it over creating a new account. This has led to a kind of lock-in effect; leaving Facebook means rearranging much of my online life. Facebook isn't just a website or a service, it's a platform.</p>
<p>This time around however I've had enough, I made a list, and I carried it through. I've (mostly) left behind Google and Facebook, and honestly, it's not been too painful a process. The intention of this post is to explain a bit about how I did it. Here's a spoiler: Apple played a big part.</p>
<p>Here's a bit of background. I've always liked to manage my own digital life in my own way. The more that software platforms have become a kind of homogenized, 'let me do everything for you' kind of deal, the more I've shied away from them. Case in point: I use a MacBook Pro and an iPhone exclusively. Previously I've been a Windows user with an Android phone. It's in order to keep myself portable enough to change platforms like this that I've never liked to use any of the vendor lock-in products that these platforms offer. I've never used Apple's iCloud services before, for example, because of what would have to happen if I were to move away from Apple's products in the future. I've tried to keep agile and use products and services that won't lock me into a particular platform. That's why I've been a heavy Google user until now because it's perfectly portable.</p>
<p>Another case in point: as a father or two young kids my family photo collection has grown pretty sizeable. I've followed the same kind of do-it-yourself mentality with that too, shunning Apple's and Google's photo management offerings in favour of managing my own directory structure on an external HDD. This HDD is then duplicated via Carbon Copy Cleaner to another external HDD, and then I manually upload the delta to Dropbox as a remote backup. It's a hassle doing things this way, but I'm free to manage my collection in my own way, and again it's totally portable.</p>
<p>Why am I mentioning these cases? Because the more I've thought about things recently, the more I've realized for the first time that portability really isn't that important to me anymore. Apple's products are fantastic (aside from some recent software bugs, but I trust them to stabilize things soon), and their privacy policy is amazing compared to other large corporations. In light of my increasing distrust of Google I'm not likely to be moving to an Android phone any time soon, and as a software developer who has the need to develop for iOS, macOS is the best operating system for my needs. Accepting this and committing fully to Apple products has been weirdly freeing, it's allowed me to go all-in on using their services as they are meant to be used, and has helped me to step away from Google in the process. Here's how.</p>
<h1 id="leavinggoogle">Leaving Google</h1>
<p><strong>Gmail, Contacts, Calendar</strong><br />
This was an easy switch to Apple's iCloud, which just like Google's offering is free to use, and offers all the functionality that I need. The only downside was having to painstakingly visit every site I have an account with and change my email address with them, but that would have happened with any new email provider.</p>
<p><strong>Google Chrome</strong><br />
There's no getting away from the fact that Chrome is a fantastic browser, and pretty indispensable for web development work. However, that doesn't mean that I need to use it for personal use. For personal use, I've switched to Apple Safari, which syncs its bookmarks and history to my iPhone just as Chrome did. For work I'll continue to use Chrome when necessary, however, this will be either logged out or logged in to my work Google account, which has no connection to my personal data.</p>
<p><strong>Google Search</strong><br />
For personal use, I'm switching to DuckDuckGo. I find that the results aren't quite as good as Google's, but the trade-off is well worth not having my every search harvested and regurgitated back to me in the form of adverts.</p>
<p><strong>Google Authenticator</strong><br />
I switched to Authy, a similar, and to be honest more fully featured alternative.</p>
<p><strong>Google Drive</strong><br />
By going all in on Apple I've deleted my paid Dropbox account and subscribed to iCloud storage instead. This replaces the need for Dropbox of course but also Google Drive. Bye, bye Google drive.</p>
<p><strong>Google Docs</strong><br />
I don't have the need to collaborate with others for my own personal documents, which are mostly just for my annual accounting and personal finance. Switching to Apple's productivity apps (specifically Numbers and Pages) has allowed me to replace everything that I was using Google Docs for, and it's nicely integrated with iCloud too.</p>
<p><strong>YouTube</strong><br />
Let's be honest, there's nothing I can do here. The vast majority of online video I'd want to watch is hosted on YouTube. The best idea I can come up with is to continue to use YouTube in signed out mode. I'd lose the ability to follow channels and comment on videos, but I can still watch anything (unless it's of an adult nature, but that's not an issue, I mostly just watch software development stuff). It's not ideal but hey.</p>
<p><strong>Google Play Books</strong><br />
Apple Books.</p>
<p><strong>Google Maps</strong><br />
Apple Maps.</p>
<p><strong>Google Reminders</strong><br />
Apple Reminders.</p>
<p>While not a direct factor in leaving Google, I previously used Boostnote to store my personal notes. Going all-in on Apple means that I'm now using Apple Notes as a replacement. It's been fun to systematically delete accounts and products and replace them all with something that was previously just collecting dust within my operating system. It feels good, although if Apple ever disappears I'm totally fucked.</p>
<h1 id="leavingfacebook">Leaving Facebook</h1>
<p>Leaving Facebook felt completely different to leaving Google. My feelings toward Google were cold, uncaring, but I was surprised to find that I had an emotional connection with my Facebook account. I'd been on the platform for 11 years, and viewing my home feed was like seeing a history of some of the most important aspects of my life; my marriage, the births of my kids, family deaths, holidays, happy memories with family and friends. Viewing my Instagram account was equally emotional, it's a cherry-picked selection of some of my favourite moments of my adult life, all shown in a romantic haze of sepia-vision.</p>
<p>The ultimate realization, however, is that the emotional connection is to the events themselves, not Facebook's representation of them. I still have the memories and the photos. I'd come this far, and while it felt a little painful to do, Facebook had to go.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook</strong><br />
Another way that deleting Facebook differs from deleting Google is that for me there was no need to seek alternatives, which probably goes to show how superfluous the service really is. Replacing the core Facebook experience is simply a case of meeting friends, calling or sending old-fashioned SMS messages to them. As for external accounts that I'd previously opened with Facebook authorization, I either converted them to full accounts using my new email address, or I simply trashed them.</p>
<p><strong>Messenger</strong><br />
Deleting my Facebook account meant deleting my access to Messenger. While I personally don't care for Messenger too much it's used a lot within my family as a means of communication, and stepping away from it could inconvenience family members who would then have to go out of their way to contact me in other ways. I was happy to learn that I can still use Messenger without a Facebook account, by simply signing up again with my phone number. It's not ideal as my messages are still visible to Facebook, but I rarely send personal information via Messenger, and without a Facebook profile for them to tie my data too I'm not too concerned.</p>
<p><strong>WhatsApp</strong><br />
While my family uses Messenger quite heavily, my friends tend to use WhatsApp. While WhatsApp is a part of the Facebook family, just like Instagram it wasn't always. The key is that WhatsApp was built with end-to-end encryption (something that Facebook would never have done themselves), meaning that Facebook has no access to the content of my messages. WhatsApp uses a completely different account to the Facebook account too, so deleting Facebook hasn't affected my use of WhatsApp.</p>
<p><strong>Instagram</strong><br />
I killed it. It's gone forever. Honestly I never really used this as a social platform, more as a personal photo album, so there's nothing to replace.</p>
<p>That's it. All in the process took all of my spare time for the best part of a week but I think it was well worth it. I feel somehow lighter because of it. However everybody's situation is different, and I don't recommend anybody to leave Google or Facebook without first giving it a lot of consideration, it's a very personal decision.</p></div>
