The full name of this post should really read: "How to become a senior developer, from somebody who is one, relayed to you by somebody who isn't one"!

I recently sat down with my employer Circular Wave's co-founder and CTO Ashley Rudland, for my end-of -first-year-as-a-developer catch up meeting. Amongst a whole ton of stuff one of the main topics we discussed was what it would take for me to get from where I currently am, a junior developer with one year's professional experience, all the way to to being a senior developer. Ash is well suited to address this topic, having something like sixteen years of professional development experience under his belt already.

After a discussion around what I personally thought would be the most imporant skills for a senior developer to posses, Ash wrote down his own well considered thoughts around this, neatly split into 5 separate bullet points, and interestingly in order of importance. Seeing Ash's list was quite eye-opening for me, specifically I was surprised at the order of priority. Many of the skills come with experience, so naturally aren't posessed by too many junior developers, however by surrounding yourself with more experienced developers these skills can be aquired earlier than experince would usually allow.

With Ash's permission I've gone into detail below on his list of the five most important skills required of a senior developer, in order (from most important to least).

# Persistence, resilience & emotional control

This is the most important skill that a senior developer should posses. A good senior developer shouldn't get flustered by, or frustrated with their work. While a junior developer might reach a point where they simply give up and ask for help, a senior developer should always have the confidence in their abilities, the resilient attitude and the perserverence to keep hacking away at the problem, until eventually it gets resolved. Even in the face of major adversity, a senior developer will find a way to get the job done.

# Semantic tree analysis & problem solving



# Shipping product fast & customer value

I liken this skill to having the ability to remove yourself from the current situation, from deep within the coding trenches, and view it from 10,000 feet above instead.

There have been times where I've personally been handed a task to complete, and that task has eventually proven to be much more difficult to complete than anybody had accounted for, due to one of a whole host of reasons. As a junior developer, my mind has naturally moved toward 'how can I get this working as specified?'. I want to complete the task that I've been given, in exactly the way that it's been specified, because anything less feels like giving up or asking for help with something that I should be capable of doing myself. Several times Ash has eventually got involded when it's become clear that I've been having problems. While I've been deep in the code, surrounded by broken functionality that I'm trying hard to fix, Ash would say something like: 'Okay that's much more complicated than we thought it would be, why don't we try *this* instead. It's a different solution, but will be just as useful for the customer'.

What I'm referring to here is the senior developer ability to view things from a different perspective, and ask what the customer actually wants or needs, and how can we quickly get an approximation of that to them. It's asking the big questions, not just 'how can we build this feature as specified', but 'should we even be building this feature? Is there a simpler way to produce a broadly similar result for the end user?'.

# Tech ability

I was very surprised at how low tech ability rates in this list, because I gave it the number 1 spot in my own list. From my perspective as a junior developer, one key skill that a senior developer should possess is a high level of technical ability. To my mind they rely much less on documentation, because all of their years of experience have filled their memory with enough examples that they just 'know' how to do things.

While this is true to a certain extent, Ash lists it as one of the lower priority skills, because a senior developer should just eb able to pick up technical abilities when needed. Once a certain baseline level of capability is reached, a senior developer should just be able to pick up anything else they need ot know along the way, whether it's slightly familiar or a new concept entirely. Senior developers don't have all fo the answers in their head, they're just good at finding those answers when they need to.

# Architecture / Foresight for roadmap

A senior developer should always keep an eye on the underlying architecture of their product. There are always ways of speeding up, simplifying or optimising the architecture, and these methods can often provide a far larger benefit than simply trying to optimise code.

A junior developer will try to write code that works. A mid-level developer will try to write code that's well optimised. A senior developer will look at hosting their code in a more optimal environment, and delivering it to the end user is the most optimal way possible. Optimising code can have a big impact for the better, but getting the architecture right can totally change the game.

Foresight for roadmap means essentially keeping an eye on the future requirements of your product. Don't simply build something in a certain way because it works for the current task, instead consider the tasks you'll also be working on in the coming months/years ahead, and make sure that your current tasks are designed and built to work with, and not limit, those future plans. A senior developer should instinctively be thinking about the future, rather than just looking at the short term.

# Conclusion

Some of these skills will naturally come with experience, whiel some can be hacked earlier than experiecne would allow. The key for me is that now I'm aware of these skills, I can keep them in mind, and consider them throughout every task that I'm a part of. This will only benefit those tasks, and my own personal development too.
